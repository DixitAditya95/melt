# externalPythonMatcher
This project shows exemplarily how a matcher can be implemented in Python and packed for SEALS/HOBBIT using MELT. The 
matcher is implemented in [pythonMatcher.py](/examples/externalPythonMatcher/oaei-resources/pythonMatcher.py) using  the 
[rdflib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib). It is wrapped in 
[DemoPythonMatcher.java](/de/uni_mannheim/informatik/dws/melt/demomatcher/DemoPythonMatcher.java).

In case you need executable Python programs you can use [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/), for instance.

The overall documentation of MELT can be found in the [main README](/README.md).
