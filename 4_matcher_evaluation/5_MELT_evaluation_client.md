# MELT Evaluation Client

If you have one or more packaged matching systems ([SEALS](https://dwslab.github.io/melt/matcher-packaging/seals), [Docker Web](https://dwslab.github.io/melt/matcher-packaging/web#melt-web-packaging)) or simply a URL pointing to a matching service and want to evaluate those, you can [write a Java program to evaluate those](https://dwslab.github.io/melt/matcher-evaluation#more-complex-evaluation-example).

Alternatively, you can use the **MELT Evaluation Client** which is discussed in this section. The client is a simple java command line tool that is executed in a terminal and does not require any coding skills or deep understanding of MELT, SEALS, or the Docker Web format.
