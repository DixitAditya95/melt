# Contribute
Everybody is welcome to contribute to MELT. There are 3 options to help the project:
1) [**Spread the Word**](#spread-the-word)
2) [**Improve the Documentation**](#improve-the-documentation)
3) [**Improve and Extend the Code Base**](#improve-and-extend-the-code-base)


## Spread the Word
If you are using MELT, [reference](https://dwslab.github.io/melt/cite-melt) and recommend the framework to peers. 

## Improve the Documentation
You do not have to be a programmer to help MELT. You can easily help us by improving the documentation (this user guide). The contents of the guide are managed through GitHub; just go to the [MELT gh-pages branch](https://github.com/dwslab/melt/tree/gh-pages). There, you will find a [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file for every page in this user guide. The markdown file for this page, for instance can be found here: []()


## Improve and Extend the Code Base
If you are knowlegeable in Java and/or Python and you want to add features to MELT or fix bugs: Simply [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). We are happy to merge any improvements in the main branch.

MELT code quality is ensured by more than 200 [unit tests](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#:~:text=JUnit%20Jupiter%20is%20the%20combination%20of%20the%20new,JUnit%204%20based%20tests%20on%20the%20platform.%201.2.). You can check that you did not accidently break anything with your changes by running them. Ideally, you also create a unit test for your new feature / your fix to ensure that it works as intended.
